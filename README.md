# Update cloudflare record

This is a simple and ugly script to update a single __cloudflare A record__ and get notified when it happens via email
Use case: home server, raspberry pi open on network...

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠

Cloudflare up to now does not support record update trough api for following extensions:  .cf, .ga, .gq, .ml, or .tk

## Suppported OS

- Linux
- macOS

## Usage

```
./script.sh [-s config_file.json]
```

## Installing

Just clone it on your machine

```
git clone https://github.com/CatMonster/update-cloudflare-record.git
```

### Install dependencies

#### Linux

Debian or debian based like Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install jq mailutils
```

Fedora

```
sudo dnf install jq mailx
```

Archlinux or arch based

```
sudo pacman -Sy jq mailutils
```

#### macOS

```
brew install jq
```

## Configuring

Now you need to retrive all needed data to make work properly the script

### Cloudflare

Api Key
1) Log into your cloudflare account -> [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2) Go on to your profile page
3) At the page end there is a section called "API Keys", hit "View" button to get the __Global API Key__

### Record

1) Select interested zone
2) Go under "DNS" section
3) Right bewlow, there is a section called "API", copy `Zone ID` key

4) By using [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) or whatever method you prefer, use that API call to get a full list of all records inside the specific zone: `zones/:zone_identifier/dns_records` (more info inside [cloudflare api doc](https://api.cloudflare.com/%23dns-records-for-a-zone-list-dns-records)), replace `:zone_identifier` with key copied previously
5) Take the response and copy the interested `id`

Now you can fill out the [config.json](https://github.com/CatMonster/update-cloudflare-record/blob/master/config.json), under cloudflare object you need to put all retrived data until now like in this exaple below

```json
...

"cloudflare" : {
    "email": "your_cloudflare_account_email",
    "zones": "zone_id",
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "record": "id"
  },

...
```

#### Mailing system

If __ssmtp__ isn't configured yet, you need to find the working config for your mail provider, Google and stackExchange are best your friends :smirk:, I'm using gmail and [this config](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/381197/325117) works fine for me.

Inside [config.json](https://github.com/CatMonster/update-cloudflare-record/blob/master/config.json), under mail, you can specify the recipient and a custom subject. If you don't need to send a mail, just leave them blank.

```json
...

  "mail" : {
    "recipient": "",
    "subject": ""
  }

...
```

Any modification at the mail body can be done on [mail_template](https://github.com/CatMonster/update-cloudflare-record/blob/master/mail_template) file.

#### Running periodically

Personally for home use I set a cron running every minute, it's pretty safe because Cloudflare api can be called 1200 times in 5 minutes, for [ipfy.org](https://www.ipify.org/) you can do "millions of requests per minute" as they say; keep that in mind if you are planning to conquest the galaxy.

To set a cron, type ```crontab -e``` and you'll get a file like that

Make sure to set system variables to get all commands working as well

```
printenv | grep SHELL && printenv | grep PATH
```

otherwise export them:

```
export SHELL=/bin/bash
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
```

and call your script

```
* * * * * cd /home/user/scripts/update-cloudflare-record/; ./script.sh -s config.json
```

As mentioned above i run that every minute; by replacing __* * * * *__ you can set whatever time you want. If you are cron noob like me take a look at [crontab guru's website](https://crontab.guru/) and all their [examples](https://crontab.guru/examples.html)
